Using NBP API to calculate amount of money, depends on current GBP rate. 

App start on localhost port (by deafault **:8080**) using **"/GBP"** ednpoint. I have created basic UI.

App unfortunetly is using deafult values only (passed in ExchangeClinet class).
More description you can find in code comments.

App is based on the Spring Boot + Thymeleaf.



I find issues trying to get values from user inputs and pass it through app. I will highly appreciate any feedback, what I can change to make it works :)
